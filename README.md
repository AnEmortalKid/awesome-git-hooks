How to use git hooks - resources and examples.

## What are git hooks?
> "Like many other Version Control Systems, Git has a way to fire off custom scripts when certain important actions occur. There are two groups of these hooks: client-side and server-side. Client-side hooks are triggered by operations such as committing and merging, while server-side hooks run on network operations such as receiving pushed commits. You can use these hooks for all sorts of reasons." - [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks)
