How to use git hooks - resources and examples.

## What are git hooks?
> "Like many other Version Control Systems, Git has a way to fire off custom scripts when certain important actions occur. There are two groups of these hooks: client-side and server-side. Client-side hooks are triggered by operations such as committing and merging, while server-side hooks run on network operations such as receiving pushed commits. You can use these hooks for all sorts of reasons." - [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks)

## Overview of Samples
This repo contains the following samples:

**_commit-msg samples_**
- **enforce-insert-issue-number:** Make sure user did not delete the ISSUE-[#] string that was generated by prepare-commit-msg/insert-issue-number.sample

**_pre-commit samples_**
- **format-code:** Run command to format code and re-add any files modified after formatting
- **search-term:** Fail commit if a specific term is found in the code
- **verify-name-and-email:** Fail commit if user.name or user.email is incorrect

**_prepare-commit-msg samples_**
- **insert-issue-number:** Insert issue number to beginning of the commit message

**_miscellaneous samples_**
- **default samples:** samples that are automatically generated in .git/hooks

## Helpful Hints
You can bypass pre-commit hooks by adding `--no-verify` to end of `git commit` command
